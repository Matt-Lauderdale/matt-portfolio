    	<h1>Welcome To LAMA Longboards</h1>
      <p>Lama Longboards originated in the basement of a townhome in a northern suberb of Atlanta, GA in the fall of 2003. The original press consisted of 2 20 ton bottle jacks and a wooden press. Since then, we've graduated to a more updated facility with custom hydraulic presses. Although we have updated much of our equipment, we still make every board individually and by hand to ensure that each deck lives up to our high quality standard.</p>
      <p>As you can see, we started very small like most companies, but have been able to expand thanks to the love that we all have for spreading the stoke. We love to teach others how to build their own, so feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> if you would like to learn to build your own.</p>
